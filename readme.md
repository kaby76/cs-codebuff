# CS-Codebuff

This project is a port of [Codebuff](https://github.com/antlr/codebuff) to C#, generated from Tangible Software Solutions' excellent Code Converter, and then hand-tuned
to resolve certain problems not caught by Code Converter.

Codebuff is a formatting tool that uses a novel approach via a machine learning algorithm 
(http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2997383 https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08866).
